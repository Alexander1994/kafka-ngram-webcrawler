# kafka-ngram-webcrawler

This application was developed as a prototype idea for exploring kafka, [ngrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram) and webcrawling.

### To Add
- filtering by word size or list of words
- searching list of pages

### Crazy idea
- Creating a continous stream / webcrawler

### Current known issues
- Accounting for periods in text when creating ngrams
- Whitespace issues with ngram divider (might be fixed, requires more research)
- Properly dividing text for ngrams based on HTML guidelines
